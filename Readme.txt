Nowadays the recommendation systems have become a necessity seen the mass of information
accumulated for each site and search engines, so that the user can find his or her targeted
information easily. For this there are several methods including collaborative filtering and content-based
filtering, for each approach there is an extensive list of procedural choices.
Our work consists in studying the different methods and algorithms of the domain of the recommendation
under the angle of the collaborative filtering Our objective is to implement its algorithms and make it a practical
application for the recommendation based on collaborative filtering.
Not far from the machine learning, the use of a data set Benchmark is crucial for the good evaluation of the algorithms of the collaborative filtering in order to draw a conclusion on the performances of the algorithms of the latter.
